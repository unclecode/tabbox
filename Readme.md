# TabBox: Your Tab Management Solution

## The Problem
Managing tabs is a common struggle. As knowledge workers, we often keep numerous tabs open for reference, research, and ongoing tasks. While tab management extensions help organize them, we need a better way to:
- Preserve URLs for future reference
- Search through our browsing history meaningfully
- Access and understand saved content easily
- Keep our knowledge organized and searchable

TabBox is the first step toward solving this. Future versions will include:
- Content crawling and summarization
- AI-powered search interface
- Knowledge base creation from saved URLs
- Conversational interface to interact with saved content

## Current Features
- Instantly capture all open tab URLs with Command+Shift+Y (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Y (Windows)
- Auto-copy URLs to clipboard
- Export URLs to text file
- Customizable save directory
- Clean, minimal interface
